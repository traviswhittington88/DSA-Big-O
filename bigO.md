# What is the Big O for this?

1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

Constant Time - O(1)

2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

Linear Time - O(n)

2. Even or odd
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else
        return false;
    }
}

Constant Time - O(1). This is because regardless of the input, e.g. 100 or 1 million the time it takes to determine if the number is odd or even remains the same. 

3. Are you here?
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function areYouHere(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        const el1 = arr1[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const el2 = arr2[j];
            if (el1 === el2) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Polynomial Time - O(n^k) or O(n^2) in this case. Nested loops are polynomial time complexity because the input is unknown and the exponent is based on the number of for loops. In this example there is 1 nest for loop (2 loops total) making this a polynomial time of O(n^2). Depending on input size the time complexity will grow 'exponentially'. E.g. an input of 3 in this algorithm would take 3^2 or 9 seconds, milliseconds, etc. An input of 100 would be 100 ^ 2 or 10,000 milliseconds, seconds, etc.

4. Doubler
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}

Linear Time - O(n) because you are making insertions into an array. The longer/larger the input is directly related to the number of operations and increase of time. 

5. Naive search
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}

Polynomial Time/Quadratic Time O(n^2) - depending on the input size, the worse possible complexity is that the for loop will have to pass through every item in the array. This would be some input constant raised to the 2nd power, e.g. 10 ^ 2 = 1000ms or 1 second. 

6. Creating pairs:
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function createPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i] + ", " +  arr[j] );
        }
    }
}

Linear time - O(n) because the algorithm is not performing a sort, insert, or delete on the array. It is only accessing the data and displaying it as a 'pair'. The larger the array the more time it takes. 



7. Compute the sequence
What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i == 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

This algorithm inserts n values into a result array depending on the size of n. If the number is 1 a single value of 0 is passed to the result array. If the number is 2; 0 & 1 are passed as elements to the array. Otherwise, the algorithm pushes a value of result[i - 2] + result[i -3] to the succeeding elements of the array. For example, if the input is 5 the algorithm will insert into result.. 0, 1, 1 + 0, 1 + 1, 2 + 1 or [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].  result[1-2] and result[1-3] indicate the stored values within the index of i -2 + i -3. 

The runtime is Polynomial Cubic - O(n^3) at worst complexity because it requires 3 operations per tick if the input is larger than 2. For each cycle where the number is larger than 2 the algorithm must access 2 separate indeces from the array and insert that value into a new element resulting in 3 operations per tick. 


8. An efficient search
In this example, we return to the problem of searching using a more sophisticated approach than in naive search, above. Assume that the input array is always sorted. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function efficientSearch(array, item) {
    let minIndex = 0;
    let maxIndex = array.length - 1;
    let currentIndex;
    let currentElement;

    while (minIndex <= maxIndex) {
        currentIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
        currentElement = array[currentIndex];

        if (currentElement < item) {
            minIndex = currentIndex + 1;
        }
        else if (currentElement > item) {
            maxIndex = currentIndex - 1;
        }
        else {
            return currentIndex;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

9. Random element
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}

10. What Am I?
What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isWhat(n) {
    if (n < 2 || n % 1 != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

11. Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a very famous mathematical puzzle (some call it game!). This is how it goes:

There are three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest disk at the top (making a conical shape). The other two rods are empty to begin with.
The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of rods to another rod (can't be the original rod where it was stacked before) where it will be stacked in the ascending order as well. This should be done obeying the following rules: i) Only one disk may be moved at a time ii) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod. iii) A larger disk may not placed on top of a smaller disk
Input:

Rod A	Rod B	Rod C
----		
---------		
-------------		
Output:

Rod A	Rod B	Rod C
----
---------
-------------
Derive an algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
Implement your algorithm using recursion. Your program should display each movement of the disk from one rod to another.
If you are given 5 disks, how do the rods look like after 7 recursive calls?
How many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 3 disks? with 4 disks? with 5 disks?
What is the runtime of your algorithm?
